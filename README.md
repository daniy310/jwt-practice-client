This project demonstrates the client-side of a PERN full stack application.

It includes :
 - 3 main components
   - Register for registering a new account in our database - using postgreSQL and password bcrypt encryption
   - Login for logging into the app
   - Dashboard - a mock for the logged users
 - React Toastify notifications for each auth action
 
On each auth action a JWT is generated with a secret code and an expiration period and then it is set in the local storage. 
If the JWT exists, the authentication is made automatically and from the /login or /register routes the user will be redirected to /dashboard. 

For each action an http request is sent to the server ran locally.
